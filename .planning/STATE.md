## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from 49 requirements following hexagonal dependency rule (innermost first)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 4 (Review Intelligence) isolated as dedicated phase -- highest complexity, core differentiator
- [Roadmap]: Phases 4 and 5 are independent (both depend on Phase 3) but sequenced 4-before-5 to prioritize differentiator

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Phase 4 needs verification of go-github struct fields for review comments before planning
- [Research]: Thread resolution status (is_resolved) may require GraphQL -- REST availability unconfirmed
